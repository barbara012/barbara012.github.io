Everything I do, I do it for you;
Look into my eyes;
You will see what you mean to me;
Search your heart, search your soul;
And when you find me there;
you'll search no more;
Don't tell me it's not worth trying for;
You can't tell me it's not worth dying for;
You know it's true;
Everything I do, I do it for you;
Look into your heart;
You will find there's nothing there to hide;
Take me as I am, take my life;
I would give it all I would sacrifice;
Don't tell me it's not worth fighting for;
I can't help it, there's nothing I want more;
You know it's true;
Everything I do, I do it for you.;
There's no love like your love;
And no other could give more love;
There's nowhere unless you're there;
All the time, all the way;
Oh! You can't tell me it's not worth trying for;
I can't help it, there's nothing I want more;
I would fight for you, I'd die for you;
You know it's true;
Everything I do, I do it for you
